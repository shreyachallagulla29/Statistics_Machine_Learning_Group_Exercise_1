This group exercise on data preprocessing and feature selection, completed as part of the course requirements. The exercise focuses on applying techniques covered in class using a healthcare dataset related to stroke prediction.

We handled missing values using appropriate imputation methods and applied both Z-score standardization and Min-Max normalization to scale numerical features. To demonstrate noise handling, artificial noise was added to a numerical feature and reduced using a smoothing technique, with results compared visually. Outliers were identified using the Z-score method and handled in a justified manner to improve data quality.

For feature selection, we applied a correlation-based filter method to remove highly correlated features and used Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Logistic Regression to identify the most important features.
